description: "According to the National Retail Federation, the average American will spend $462.95 on holiday gifts for family members. That doesn't leave a whole lot of scratch to spend on friends, co-workers, pets, maybe a little something nice for yourself, plus decorations, cards, postage, food, and booze. Good god, don't forget the alcohol!"
